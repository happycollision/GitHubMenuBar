# Release Notes Template

## Standard Author's Note to Include

The following author's note should be included in every set of release notes created for this app:

> A note from "the author". This note you are reading is the only code I manually contributed to this repo. I've never looked at a single file, only diffs presented to me from Claude Code. So you need to ask yourself if you trust me and also if you trust Claude Code before you download, install, and run this thing. Mostly if you trust Claude Code, honestly. I am really just the the VP of Product for this thing: technically knowledgeable, but not necessarily about this language or this codebase in particular. (I've literally never hand-coded a lick of Swift in my life so far.)

> But this toolbar app sure does scratch an itch that I personally have.

## Usage

When creating GitHub release notes, include the above author's note in the release description along with the standard release notes content (new features, bug fixes, etc.).
